# How to Run
Note that you will need to download the dataset from Kaggle (done automatically in the code) or have run the code as outlined in the `create_dataset` directory.

* For surface reflectance data, update the file paths in `SR_Rapid_Feature_Extraction.ipynb` and run.
* For top-of-atmosphere reflectance data, updates the file paths in `TOA_Rapid_Feature_Extraction.ipynb` and run.
