# Models

This directory contains the code for all the machine learning models created in this project.

It is split into two directories:
* `Impact of Agricultural Practices`
* `SOC Mapping`

# SOC Mapping
* To run these models, you will first need the extracted features CSV files.

* Please see `README.md` in the `feature_extraction` directory for instructions.

* You will also need the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD) attributes database. Go to this link: https://www.fao.org/soils-portal/soil-survey/soil-maps-and-databases/harmonized-world-soil-database-v12/en/ Click "Download database (.mdb)" and export as CSV.

* Update the file paths in the `.ipynb` files and run.
